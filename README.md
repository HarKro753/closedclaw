ClosedClaw is a self-hosted platform where every user in your organization gets a personal AI agent. Each agent has its own persistent memory, private workspace, skill system, and full tool access — including bash, file editing, web browsing, and web search. Deploy with Docker Compose.

## Features

- **One agent per user** — isolated workspace, memory, and skill set per account
- **13 built-in tools** — bash execution, read/write/edit/delete files, web search, web fetch, memory search, daily notes, skill management
- **Memory system** — `MEMORY.md` for long-term memory + daily `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` notes + full-text `memory_search` across all files
- **Skill system** — drop a `SKILL.md` into your agent's `skills/` directory; the agent auto-discovers and loads it on demand
- **SSE streaming** — agent responses stream token-by-token to the dashboard via Server-Sent Events
- **Clean dark UI** — minimal dashboard inspired by the best open-source chat UIs
- **Admin panel** — user management and agent status overview
- **CLI for local dev** — interactive REPL with slash commands (`/memory`, `/soul`, `/skills`, `/clear`)
- **Self-hosted** — all data stays on your infrastructure

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarKro753/closedclaw.git
cd closedclaw

# Create .env file
cat > .env << EOF
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ADMIN_EMAILS=you@example.com
EOF

docker compose up
```

Dashboard: [http://localhost:3901](http://localhost:3901) · API: [http://localhost:3900](http://localhost:3900)

## Local Development

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.0+.

```bash
bun install

# Start server (port 3900)
bun run dev:server

# Start dashboard (port 3901)
bun run dev:dashboard
```

## CLI

```bash
# Run without installing
npx closedclaw

# Or install globally
npm install -g closedclaw && closedclaw
```

The CLI launches an interactive agent session locally — same runtime as the server, useful for testing skills and tools without deploying.

## Architecture

```
closedclaw/
  packages/
    server/      → Bun + Express API (auth, agent runtime, tools, SQLite)
    dashboard/   → Next.js 15 frontend (chat UI, SSE streaming, admin panel)
    cli/         → Local dev REPL
```

The agent runtime lives inside `packages/server/src/agent/` — it uses `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` and exposes tools via an MCP server.

```
/data/agents/<userId>/workspace/skills/
  github/
    SKILL.md    ← "Use the gh CLI for GitHub operations..."
  notion/
    SKILL.md    ← "Query the Notion API..."
```
